# Automated-Algorithmic-Trading-System


Throughout the course of Summer 2022, I dedicated myself to building the infrastructure for an automated algorithmic trading system of BEP-20 crypto-currencies in Python. Along with a colleague of mine, Mitchell Brown who is currently studying Applied Mathematics and Finance as an undergraduate at University of Notre Dame, we successfully developed and implemented an automated trading strategy utilizing algorithmic development on historical price data. 

Due to the competitve nature of the currencies that we are trading, not all code from this project will be placed in this repository. In fact, many of the functions that we used that are critical to trading and order placing, will not be featured on this repository. However, I still wanted to showcase many of the different features that we developed throughout the course of this project so it will be attached in project file. 

If you are looking for further clarification or insights into the project or one of the code files, feel free to email me at jphironimus@gmail.com  with any questions you may have.
