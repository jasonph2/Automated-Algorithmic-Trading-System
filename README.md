# Automated-Algorithmic-Trading-System
### Project by: Jason Hironimus, Mitchell Brown

Throughout the course of Summer 2022, the team was dedicated to building the infrastructure for an automated algorithmic trading system of BEP-20 crypto-currencies in Python. The team successfully developed and implemented an automated trading strategy utilizing algorithmic development on historical price data. 

Due to the competitve nature of the currencies that the team is trading, not all code from this project will be placed in this repository. In fact, many of the functions that are being utilized that are critical to trading and order placing, will not be featured on this repository. However, the team still wanted to showcase many of the different features that it developed throughout the course of this project so it will be attached in project file. 

If you are looking for further clarification or insights into the project or one of the code files, feel free to email the team at jphironimus@gmail.com or rbrown24@nd.edu with any questions you may have.
